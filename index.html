    <div class="entry">
      
        <p>As we expand our React skills to follow the Redux pattern, we are moving to a paradigm where we let the store manage state and move away from dealing with the state directly. However, there are a few exceptions, one of which is how to deal with user input from a form.</p>
<p>We saw in today’s lecture one way we can handle user input from a form:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div><div class="line">12</div><div class="line">13</div><div class="line">14</div><div class="line">15</div><div class="line">16</div><div class="line">17</div><div class="line">18</div><div class="line">19</div><div class="line">20</div><div class="line">21</div><div class="line">22</div><div class="line">23</div><div class="line">24</div><div class="line">25</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">NoteCreate</span> <span class="keyword">extends</span> <span class="title">React</span>.<span class="title">Component</span> </span>&#123;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">constructor</span>(props)&#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">super</span>(props)</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">this</span>.state = &#123;<span class="attr">note</span>: <span class="string">''</span>&#125;</div><div class="line">  &#125;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  handleInputChange(event)&#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">this</span>.setState(&#123;</div><div class="line">      <span class="attr">note</span>: event.target.value</div><div class="line">    &#125;)</div><div class="line">  &#125;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  render()&#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> (</div><div class="line">      &lt;div&gt;</div><div class="line">        &lt;h3&gt;Add a Note&lt;/h3&gt;</div><div class="line">        &lt;form onSubmit=&#123;this.handleSubmit.bind(this)&#125;&gt;</div><div class="line">          &lt;input type='text' onChange=&#123;this.handleInputChange.bind(this)&#125; value=&#123;this.state.note&#125;/&gt;</div><div class="line">          &lt;input type='submit' /&gt;</div><div class="line">        &lt;/form&gt;</div><div class="line">      &lt;/div&gt;</div><div class="line">    )</div><div class="line">  &#125;</div><div class="line">&#125;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>In the code above we’re using <code>setState()</code> on a specific component to set the value of the user input from the form.</p>
<p>This is totally fine, and as far as organizing state, the Redux docs on Organizing State address the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do I have to put all my state into Redux? Should I ever use React’s <code>setState()</code>?</p>
<p>There is no “right” answer for this. Some users prefer to keep every single piece of data in Redux, to maintain a fully serializable and controlled version of their application at all times. Others prefer to keep non-critical or UI state, such as “is this dropdown currently open”, inside a component’s internal state.</p>
<p>Using local component state is fine. As a developer, it is your job to determine what kinds of state make up your application, and where each piece of state should live. Find a balance that works for you, and go with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>As per Ian in today’s lecture, you could also approach it with the mindset that <strong>form state is something that should be managed on the application level state</strong>, and build out a <strong>form reducer that updates the current value of the form.</strong></p>
<p>However, yesterday, before we really got into it in today’s lecture, I was thinking that having a child component manage state was a little bit outside the Redux mental model that I was working towards in that <strong>the store is the single source for managing application state</strong>.</p>
<p>So I was thinking to approach it differently, using a <code>ref</code> to capture the user input of the form. For example:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div><div class="line">12</div><div class="line">13</div><div class="line">14</div><div class="line">15</div><div class="line">16</div><div class="line">17</div><div class="line">18</div><div class="line">19</div><div class="line">20</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">NoteCreate</span> <span class="keyword">extends</span> <span class="title">React</span>.<span class="title">Component</span> </span>&#123;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  handleNewNote(event) &#123;</div><div class="line">      event.preventDefault()</div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">const</span> text = <span class="keyword">this</span>.noteText.value</div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">this</span>.props.store.dispatch(&#123;<span class="attr">type</span>: <span class="string">'ADD_NOTE'</span>,<span class="attr">note</span>: text &#125;)</div><div class="line">    &#125;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  render()&#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> (</div><div class="line">      &lt;div&gt;</div><div class="line">        &lt;h3&gt;Add a Note&lt;/h3&gt;</div><div class="line">        &lt;form onSubmit=&#123;this.handleNewNote.bind(this)&#125;&gt;</div><div class="line">          &lt;input type='text' ref=&#123;(input) =&gt; this.noteText = input&#125; /&gt;</div><div class="line">          &lt;input type='submit' /&gt;</div><div class="line">          &lt;/form&gt;</div><div class="line">      &lt;/div&gt;</div><div class="line">    )</div><div class="line">  &#125;</div><div class="line">&#125;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>In this case, I’m using a <code>ref</code> callback to store a reference to the DOM element, then <strong>dispatching that value directly to the store</strong> vs. managing state locally in that component.</p>
<p>There are tradeoffs with all three approaches. The tradeoff between the <strong><code>setState()</code> approach</strong> and the <strong><code>ref</code>s approach</strong> is that with <code>setState()</code> you are tracking state with a child component, but with <code>ref</code>s you are directly accessing the DOM to pull that value. It’s a matter of preference.</p>
<hr>
<p>In general, <code>ref</code>s should be used sparingly, and only really if you can’t do something declaratively. A few other examples of when refs are useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.</li>
<li>Triggering imperative animations.</li>
<li>Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of managing focus - as an example:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">focusMethod = <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">getFocus</span>(<span class="params"></span>) </span>&#123;           </div><div class="line">  <span class="built_in">document</span>.getElementById(<span class="string">"myTextField"</span>).focus();</div><div class="line">&#125;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>and here is the the HTML:</p>
<figure class="highlight html"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">input</span> <span class="attr">type</span>=<span class="string">"text"</span> <span class="attr">id</span>=<span class="string">"myTextField"</span> <span class="attr">value</span>=<span class="string">"Text field."</span>&gt;</span></div><div class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">p</span>&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">p</span>&gt;</span></div><div class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">button</span> <span class="attr">type</span>=<span class="string">"button"</span> <span class="attr">onclick</span>=<span class="string">"focusMethod()"</span>&gt;</span>Click me to focus on the text field!<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">button</span>&gt;</span></div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

        <p>During the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Flatiron-School-Presents/events/236670613/" target="_blank" rel="external">junior developer panel</a> at Flatiron School, when asked about typical interview questions, one of the panelists mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“write a function that gets the depth of a tree”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hear and read about trees often and I don’t really know what they are, so I thought this was a good opportunity to get into it a little bit.</p>
<h2 id="Cracking-The-Coding-Interview"><a href="#Cracking-The-Coding-Interview" class="headerlink" title="Cracking The Coding Interview"></a>Cracking The Coding Interview</h2><p>On page 47 (10% into the book) of Cracking the Coding Interview, <a href="https://www.careercup.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Gayle Laakmann McDowell</a> outlines the “absolute must have basics” of data structures and algorithms to know for an interview:<br><img src="/images/ctci.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Caveats"><a href="#Caveats" class="headerlink" title="Caveats"></a>Caveats</h2><p>I want mention that while this book is really useful and comprehensive, it is seemingly geared toward the “Stanford Big Four” set - kids who graduated from Stanford and are vying to work at Google, Facebook, Apple, or Microsoft. That’s not what I’m interested in, but in any case it’s an interesting book, and it’s good to know what some other parts of the tech industry are expecting and/or bringing to the table. And as we heard in the junior developer panel, it is likely that you will be asked some sort of CS questions during the interview process.</p>
<p>McDowell mentions the above as being the absolute basics of CS concepts to know - I also think it’s important to note that CS grads can also swing the other way, with lots of theoretical knowledge and no practical experience. I personally know CS grads who had a hard time in the job hunt process because of their lack of practical experience.</p>
<p>Anyway, these are all qualifiers to clarify that we should not feel bad that we don’t know McDowell’s “absolute basics” and not feel like we have to compare ourselves in any way - the only goal is greater knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="Tree-Basics"><a href="#Tree-Basics" class="headerlink" title="Tree Basics"></a>Tree Basics</h2><p>As an introduction, my goal for this post is to share:</p>
<ol>
<li>definitions and differences between <strong>tree</strong> and a <strong>binary tree</strong> data structures</li>
<li>real life examples of general trees</li>
<li>overview of two techniques to traverse a tree</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="What-A-Tree-Is-Not"><a href="#What-A-Tree-Is-Not" class="headerlink" title="What A Tree Is Not"></a>What A Tree Is Not</h2><p>A tree is not a linearly organized data structure, like an array or a linked list. <strong>A data structure is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence.</strong> A hash is also not a linearly organized data structure because its order of return cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<h2 id="General-Trees"><a href="#General-Trees" class="headerlink" title="General Trees"></a>General Trees</h2><p><img src="/images/generalTree.jpg" alt=""><br>A <strong>general tree</strong> is a data structure with nodes. There is no limit on the degree of nodes in a general tree, and each node can have an infinite number of children.</p>

<p>Real life examples of general trees:<br><img src="/images/tree2.png" alt=""><br>The DOM<br><img src="/images/tree3.png" alt=""><br>Phylogenetics</p>
<h2 id="Binary-Trees"><a href="#Binary-Trees" class="headerlink" title="Binary Trees"></a>Binary Trees</h2><p><img src="/images/binaryTree.jpg" alt=""><br>A <strong>binary tree</strong> is a data structure in that each node has at most two nodes: left and right.</p>
<p>Real life examples of binary trees:<br><img src="/images/familyTree.png" alt=""><br>Family tree</p>
<h2 id="Advantages-Of-Trees"><a href="#Advantages-Of-Trees" class="headerlink" title="Advantages Of Trees"></a>Advantages Of Trees</h2><p>Trees are useful and frequently used because they have some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trees <strong>reflect structural relationships</strong> in the data</li>
<li>Trees are used to <strong>represent hierarchies</strong></li>
<li>Trees provide an <strong>efficient insertion and searching</strong></li>
<li>Trees are <strong>very flexible</strong> data, allowing to <strong>move subtrees around with minimum effort</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Techniques-For-Traversing-A-Tree"><a href="#Techniques-For-Traversing-A-Tree" class="headerlink" title="Techniques For Traversing A Tree"></a>Techniques For Traversing A Tree</h2><p>Traversing a tree can either take a breadth-first or a depth-first approach.</p>
<h2 id="Breadth-First-Search"><a href="#Breadth-First-Search" class="headerlink" title="Breadth First Search"></a>Breadth First Search</h2><p>Explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.</p>
<p><img src="/images/breadthFirst2.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There are three different types of depth-first traversals:</p>
<ul>
<li>PreOrder traversal - visit the parent first and then left and right children</li>
<li>InOrder traversal - visit the left child, then the parent and the right child</li>
<li>PostOrder traversal - visit left child, then the right child and then the parent</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/breadthTraversals.bmp" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Depth-First-Search"><a href="#Depth-First-Search" class="headerlink" title="Depth First Search"></a>Depth First Search</h2><p>Explores all the children of a neighboring node before moving to the next neighbor and its children.</p>
<p><img src="/images/depthFirst2.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There is only one kind of breadth-first traversal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level order traversal. This traversal visits nodes by levels from <strong>top to bottom and from left to right.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the Hide and Seek lab, we traversed the DOM to find specific nodes using <code>document.querySelector()</code> and <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code>. Depending on how you implemented the <code>deepestChild</code> function, it can be amended to return the depth of the tree as opposed to just returning the deepest child.</p>

        <p>“Falsehoods Programmers Believe” is a collection compiled by Kevin Deldycke at <a href="https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood" target="_blank" rel="external">Awesome Falsehood</a>. Falsehoods Programmers Believe are misconceptions or assumptions than can negatively impact programming decisions and our codebase. There are falsehoods in many categories including human identity, shopping, music, date and time, and more. The initial blog post that started it all is titled <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/" target="_blank" rel="external">“<em>Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names</em>“</a> by Patrick McKenzie. In the post McKenzie says, “Anything someone tells you is their name is — by definition — an appropriate identifier for them.”</p>
<p>In the classic <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> Dale Carnegie says, “a person’s name is, to that person, the sweetest and most important sound in any language.”</p>
<p>However, the systems we design as programmers often fail to acknowledge this fundamental aspect of a person’s identity.</p>
<h4 id="“Your-last-name-contains-invalid-characters”"><a href="#“Your-last-name-contains-invalid-characters”" class="headerlink" title="“Your last name contains invalid characters”"></a>“Your last name contains invalid characters”</h4><p><img src="/images/invalid.png" alt=""></p>
<p>John Graham-Cumming’s blog post <a href="http://blog.jgc.org/2010/06/your-last-name-contains-invalid.html" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>“Your last name contains invalid characters”</em></a> describes his personal experience and frustration with how web forms handle his hyphenated last name. The hyphen in his last name is often treated by many web forms as invalid input.</p>
<p>He says, “Does the web site have any idea how rude it is to claim that my last name contains invalid characters? Clearly not. What they actually meant is: our web site will not accept that hyphen in your last name. But do they say that? No, of course not. They decide to shove in my face the claim that there’s something wrong with my name.”</p>
<p>Additionally, some web forms will accept the hyphen in his name but have rules about how to deal with what comes after the hyphen. Graham-Cumming says, “Yahoo oddly believes that I don’t know how to type my own name and decides to lowercase the C in Cumming. It’s willing to accept the hyphen but not that I know who I am.”</p>
<p><img src="/images/invalid2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Graham Cumming’s experiences are just one example of how our own preconceptions can fail in the wild, and additionally add insult to injury with “suggestions” for customers who do not fit into our preconceived mold.</p>
<p>Graham-Cumming continues, “There’s nothing wrong with my name […] What is wrong is the way this is being handled. If the system can’t cope with non-letters and spaces it needs to say that. […] So, form designers: stop blaming the user for your inadequacies.”</p>
<h4 id="“Hello-I’m-Mr-Null-My-Name-Makes-Me-Invisible-to-Computers”"><a href="#“Hello-I’m-Mr-Null-My-Name-Makes-Me-Invisible-to-Computers”" class="headerlink" title="“Hello, I’m Mr. Null. My Name Makes Me Invisible to Computers”"></a>“Hello, I’m Mr. Null. My Name Makes Me Invisible to Computers”</h4><p>Christopher Null <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/11/null/" target="_blank" rel="external">writes in WIRED</a> about his experience with web forms due to his last name. As programmers likely know, the word <strong>null</strong> is a reserved keyword that in some languages is used to indicate that a data value does not exist.</p>
<p>For Null, entering his last name into a web form is often invalid - the form will prompt him to reenter a last name, with the error message that the last name cannot be left blank. For these cases, Null has come up with a workaround - he amends his last name to use it in combination with a middle name, or adds a period at the end, i.e. “Null.”</p>
<p>Null also mentions that he frequently receives letters in the mail with his last name omitted, or addressed to simply “Mr.”</p>
<h4 id="Uncovering-Falsehoods"><a href="#Uncovering-Falsehoods" class="headerlink" title="Uncovering Falsehoods"></a>Uncovering Falsehoods</h4><p>While the Null case may be a less egregious oversight from a cultural perspective, Christopher Null’s plight highlights yet another programmatic oversight that consequently rejects of one of the most fundamental aspects of a person’s identity.</p>
<p>As programmers, in our quest to prevent bad data from entering our database, we can often end up making poor decisions or overlooking realities that result in exclusion of individuals, whole groups, or at the very least end up causing frustration for customers.</p>
<p>The potential for these blind spots is just one business case for why diversity in the workplace is so important. With a more diverse team comes a variaty of background and experience, and consequently less risk for potential blindspots and errors.</p>

        <p>Algorithms are a fundamental part of programming, computer science, and often, job interviews. As beginner programmers, algorithms can be daunting, but whether we realize it or not we’re already implementing them in different ways through the decisions we make in our code.</p>
<h4 id="What-are-algorithms"><a href="#What-are-algorithms" class="headerlink" title="What are algorithms?"></a>What are algorithms?</h4><p>An algorithm is any repeatable process for finding the solution to a problem. If you can outline how to get to the solution step-by-step, and if you can replicate those results, you are probably using an algorithm.</p>
<h4 id="Algorithms-in-every-day-life"><a href="#Algorithms-in-every-day-life" class="headerlink" title="Algorithms in every day life"></a>Algorithms in every day life</h4><p>Algorithms don’t have to be scary - there are many algorithms at play in every-day life. Some basic algorithms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A recipe for baking cookies</li>
<li>Reorganizing your closet</li>
<li>Your morning routine</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/morning-routine.png" width="200"></p>
<h4 id="Why-do-algorithms-matter"><a href="#Why-do-algorithms-matter" class="headerlink" title="Why do algorithms matter?"></a>Why do algorithms matter?</h4><p>There are many algorithms, and each one has a different impact on how long your code takes to run, and how much memory it takes to run. That may not make a huge difference for our code today, but as our applications grow bigger and more complex it becomes increasingly important to assure that we’re writing code that’s efficient - that is, code that’s fast and does not take up a lot of space.</p>
<p>You can imagine that customers expect the websites, mobile apps, and other applications to load fast and not eat up tons of memory.</p>
<h4 id="Algorithm-efficiency-and-space-time-complexity"><a href="#Algorithm-efficiency-and-space-time-complexity" class="headerlink" title="Algorithm efficiency and space/time complexity"></a>Algorithm efficiency and space/time complexity</h4><p>Algorithm efficiency is measured in time and space complexity. Time complexity looks at <em>how long</em> an algorithm takes to solve, and space complexity is concerned with <em>how much memory</em> the algorithm takes to run. We usually end up talking more about time complexity, since space is usually more readily available than patience.</p>
<p>Let’s tackle time complexity through a mathematical framework called Big O notation:</p>
<p><img src="/images/big-o.jpg" alt="Big-O Notation"></p>
<p>In simple terms, according to Simple English Wikipedia, “Big O Notation is a way of saying how much time it takes for a mathematical algorithm to run or how much memory it uses.”</p>
<h4 id="Three-examples-and-their-Big-O-time-complexity"><a href="#Three-examples-and-their-Big-O-time-complexity" class="headerlink" title="Three examples and their Big O time complexity:"></a>Three examples and their Big O time complexity:</h4><p>Example 1: Look up an element in an array:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">cats = [“Lil Bub”, “Maru”, “Venus&quot;]</div><div class="line">cats[2]</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">more_cats = [“Garfield”, “Felix”, “Lil Bub”, “Maru”, “Mr. Jinks”,</div><div class="line">             “Venus”, “Nyan Cat”, “Stimpy&quot;]</div><div class="line">more_cats[2]</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>In the above example, the Big O time complexity is <strong>O(1) constant</strong> in that it takes the same amount of time regardless of input size. If the array was twice the size, the time it takes to run would be the same since we are always looking for the second element in the array.</p>
<hr>
<p>Example 2: Iterate over an array:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">cats = [&quot;Garfield&quot;, &quot;Felix&quot;, &quot;Lil Bub&quot;, &quot;Maru&quot;, &quot;Mr. Jinks&quot;,</div><div class="line">        &quot;Venus&quot;, &quot;Nyan Cat&quot;, &quot;Stimpy&quot;]</div><div class="line">cats.each do |cat|</div><div class="line">    puts &quot;I&apos;m petting #&#123;cat&#125;&quot;</div><div class="line">end</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>In the above example, the Big O time complexity is <strong>O(n) linear</strong> in that the time it takes corresponds to the size of the input. If the array was twice the size, the time it takes to run also grows, so it would take twice as long.</p>
<hr>
<p>Example 3: Binary search on a sorted array:</p>
<p><img src="/images/binary-search.gif" alt="Binary Search"></p>
<p>In the above example, the Big O time complexity is <strong>O(log n) logarithmic</strong> in that the time it takes is divided by half each time*. In this case, the algorithm is actually more efficient over time since the size of the array we have to search is cut in half each time.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are many more Big O notation complexities, and tons of algorithms. A handy tool for Big O is the Big O Cheat Sheet, linked below.</p>
