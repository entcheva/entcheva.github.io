        <p>During the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Flatiron-School-Presents/events/236670613/" target="_blank" rel="external">junior developer panel</a> at Flatiron School, when asked about typical interview questions, one of the panelists mentioned getting the task to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“write a function that gets the depth of a tree”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hear and read about trees a lot and I don’t really know what they are, so I thought this was a good opportunity to get into it.</p>
<p>On page 47 (10% into the book) of Cracking the Coding Interview, Gayle Laakman McDowell outlines the “absolute must have basics” of data structures and algorithms to know for an interview:<br><img src="/images/ctci.jpg" alt=""><br>I want to quality mentioning this book in that while it’s really useful and comprehensive, it is geared toward what I would call the “Stanford Big Four” set - kids who graduated from Stanford and are vying to work at Google, Facebook, Apple, or Microsoft. That’s not what I’m interested in, but in any case it’s an interesting book, and it’s good to know what some other parts of the tech industry are expecting and/or bringing to the table.</p>
<p>So, McDowell mentions the above as being the absolute basics of CS concepts to know. Now, I also think it’s important to note that CS grads can also swing the other way - with tons of theoretical knowledge and no practical experience. I personally know CS grads who have told me they wish they had more experience. So anyway, these are all qualifiers to not make us feel bad or that we have to compare ourselves in any way - the only goal is greater knowledge.</p>
<p>As per the above, my first post briefly touched on the binary search algorithm - basically an approach of divide and conquer to get to your desired result. Here’s a reminder gif (top half):<br><img src="/images/binary-search.gif" alt="Binary Search"></p>
<p>Any of these algorithms and data structures are hard to talk about in three minutes, but here are:<br>1) the basics of a binary tree data structure, through comparisons of what we’ve already discussed<br>2) the very basics of what it actually means to write a function to get the depth of a tree.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-a-tree"><a href="#What-is-a-tree" class="headerlink" title="What is a tree?"></a>What is a tree?</h2><ul>
<li>what a tree is not: it is not a linearly organized data structure. A linked list is a data structure that is linearly organized. An array is also linearly organized. In contrast, a tree is not linearly organized.</li>
<li>a tree is…</li>
</ul>
<p>A simple unordered tree:<br><img src="/images/tree1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Real life examples of trees:<br><img src="/images/tree2.png" alt=""><br><img src="/images/tree3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Searching a tree is more complicated than a linearly organized data structure like an array or linked list.</p>

        <p>I discovered this collection of blog posts: “Falsehoods Programmers Believe” through one of the resources linked in my last blog post. “Falsehoods Programmers Believe” is pretty much what it sounds like - a collection of falsehoods that programmers believe about different topics as they relate to programming. There are falsehoods on lots of categories including <strong>human identity</strong>, <strong>shopping</strong>, <strong>music</strong>, <strong>date and time</strong>, and more. The first blog post that started it all is “Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names.”</p>
<p>In our communication workshop, we talked about Dale Carnegie’s <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> - a popular self-help book about leadership and social skills. One of the “Six Ways To Make People Like You” is:</p>
<p><strong>“Remember that a person’s name is, to that person, the sweetest and most important sound in any language.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The average person is more interested in their own name than in all the other names in the world put together. People love their names so much that they will often donate large amounts of money just to have a building named after themselves. We can make people feel extremely valued and important by remembering their name.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if your name is the most important thing, it must be pretty annoying to be told that your name is wrong or invalid. Let’s look at two examples.</p>
<h2 id="John-Graham-Cumming-“Your-last-name-contains-invalid-characters”"><a href="#John-Graham-Cumming-“Your-last-name-contains-invalid-characters”" class="headerlink" title="John Graham-Cumming, “Your last name contains invalid characters”"></a>John Graham-Cumming, <em>“Your last name contains invalid characters”</em></h2><p><img src="/images/cumming.png" alt=""></p>
<p>John Graham-Cumming wrote a blog post titled <em>“Your last name contains invalid characters”</em> that shared his frustrations with how web forms deal with his hyphenated last name. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Does the web site have any idea how rude it is to claim that my last name contains invalid characters? Clearly not. What they actually meant is: our web site will not accept that hyphen in your last name. But do they say that? No, of course not. They decide to shove in my face the claim that there’s something wrong with my name.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/cumming2.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Yahoo oddly believes that I don’t know how to type my own name and decides to lowercase the C in Cumming. It’s willing to accept the hyphen but not that I know who I am.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong with my name […] What is wrong is that way this is being handled. If the system can’t cope with non-letters and spaces it needs to say that.”</p>
<p>“So, form designers: stop blaming the user for your inadequacies.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Christopher-Null-“Hello-I’m-Mr-Null-My-Name-Makes-Me-Invisible-to-Computers”"><a href="#Christopher-Null-“Hello-I’m-Mr-Null-My-Name-Makes-Me-Invisible-to-Computers”" class="headerlink" title="Christopher Null, “Hello, I’m Mr. Null. My Name Makes Me Invisible to Computers”"></a>Christopher Null, <em>“Hello, I’m Mr. Null. My Name Makes Me Invisible to Computers”</em></h2><p>Christopher Null writes in WIRED about his experience with web forms due to his last name.</p>
<p>As we know, <strong>null</strong> is a reserved string in some languages (like SQL) that is used to indicate that a data value does not exist.</p>
<p>Null writes that he often has problems with web forms where entering his last name “Null” will not work. In these cases, he has to come up with a workaround, like using his last name in combination with a middle name, or adding a period, as “Null.”</p>
<p>He also frequently gets snail mail from providers like American Express with his last name omitted, or addressed to simply “Mr.”</p>
<h2 id="Falsehoods-Programmers-Believe-About-Names"><a href="#Falsehoods-Programmers-Believe-About-Names" class="headerlink" title="Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names"></a>Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names</h2><p>Getting back to “Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names,” probably the simplest falsehood is that people have a first and last name. Different cultures deal with names differently. It is common to have the family name go first, and it is also common for a person to have a single name, or more than two names…</p>
<p>Below is a brief excerpt from the list of “Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names”:</p>
<ul>
<li>People have exactly one canonical full name.</li>
<li>People have exactly one full name which they go by.</li>
<li>People’s names fit within a certain defined amount of space.</li>
<li>People’s names do not change.</li>
<li>People’s names are written in ASCII.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be somewhat obvious, but if someone’s name is their favorite word in any language, we should refrain from telling them their names are invalid.</p>

        <p>Algorithms are a fundamental part of programming, computer science, and often, job interviews. As beginner programmers, algorithms can be daunting, but whether we realize it or not we’re already implementing them in different ways through the decisions we make in our code.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-algorithms"><a href="#What-are-algorithms" class="headerlink" title="What are algorithms?"></a>What are algorithms?</h2><p>An algorithm is any repeatable process for finding the solution to a problem.</p>
<p>If you can outline how to get to the solution step-by-step, and if you can replicate those results, you are probably using an algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="Algorithms-in-every-day-life"><a href="#Algorithms-in-every-day-life" class="headerlink" title="Algorithms in every day life"></a>Algorithms in every day life</h2><ul>
<li>A recipe for baking cookies</li>
<li>Reorganizing your closet</li>
<li>Your morning routine</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/morning-routine.png" alt="Scratch Morning Routine"></p>
<h2 id="Why-do-algorithms-matter"><a href="#Why-do-algorithms-matter" class="headerlink" title="Why do algorithms matter?"></a>Why do algorithms matter?</h2><p>There are many algorithms, and each one has a different impact on:</p>
<ul>
<li>how long your code takes to run</li>
<li>how much memory it takes to run</li>
</ul>
<p>That may not make a huge difference for our code today, but as our applications grow bigger and more complex it becomes increasingly important to assure that we’re writing code that’s efficient - that is, code that’s fast and does not take up a lot of space.</p>
<p>You can imagine that customers expect the websites, mobile apps, and other applications to load fast and not eat up tons of memory.</p>
<h2 id="Algorithm-efficiency-and-space-time-complexity"><a href="#Algorithm-efficiency-and-space-time-complexity" class="headerlink" title="Algorithm efficiency and space/time complexity"></a>Algorithm efficiency and space/time complexity</h2><p>Algorithm efficiency is measured in time and space complexity. Time complexity looks at <em>how long</em> an algorithm takes to solve, and space complexity is concerned with <em>how much memory</em> the algorithm takes to run.</p>
<p>We usually end up talking more about time complexity, since space is usually more readily available than patience.</p>
<p>Let’s tackle time complexity through a mathematical framework called Big O notation:</p>
<p><img src="/images/big-o.jpg" alt="Big-O Notation"></p>
<p>In simple terms:</p>
<p><em>“Big O Notation is a way of saying how much time it takes for a mathematical algorithm to run or how much memory it uses.” - Simple English Wikipedia</em></p>
<h2 id="Three-examples-and-their-Big-O-time-complexity"><a href="#Three-examples-and-their-Big-O-time-complexity" class="headerlink" title="Three examples and their Big O time complexity:"></a>Three examples and their Big O time complexity:</h2><p>1: Look up an element in an array:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">cats = [“Lil Bub”, “Maru”, “Venus&quot;]</div><div class="line">cats[2]</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">more_cats = [“Garfield”, “Felix”, “Lil Bub”, “Maru”, “Mr. Jinks”,</div><div class="line">             “Venus”, “Nyan Cat”, “Stimpy&quot;]</div><div class="line">more_cats[2]</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><strong>Big O time complexity: O(1) constant</strong><br><em>It takes the same amount of time regardless of input size</em></p>
<hr>
<p>2: Iterate over an array:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">cats = [&quot;Garfield&quot;, &quot;Felix&quot;, &quot;Lil Bub&quot;, &quot;Maru&quot;, &quot;Mr. Jinks&quot;,</div><div class="line">        &quot;Venus&quot;, &quot;Nyan Cat&quot;, &quot;Stimpy&quot;]</div><div class="line">cats.each do |cat|</div><div class="line">    puts &quot;I&apos;m petting #&#123;cat&#125;&quot;</div><div class="line">end</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><strong>Big O time complexity: O(n) linear</strong><br><em>The time it takes corresponds to the size of the input</em></p>
<hr>
<p>3: Binary search on a sorted array:</p>
<p><img src="/images/binary-search.gif" alt="Binary Search"></p>
<p><strong>Big O time complexity: O(log n) logarithmic</strong><br><em>The time it takes is divided by half each time</em></p>

<p>There are many more Big O notation complexities, and tons of algorithms. A handy tool for Big O is the Big O Cheat Sheet, linked below.</p>
