        <p>I discovered this collection of blog posts: “Falsehoods Programmers Believe” through one of the resources linked in my last blog post. “Falsehoods Programmers Believe” is pretty much what it sounds like - a collection of falsehoods that programmers believe about different topics as they relate to programming. There are falsehoods on lots of categories including <strong>human identity</strong>, <strong>shopping</strong>, <strong>music</strong>, <strong>date and time</strong>, and more. The first blog post that started it all is “Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names.”</p>
<p>In our communication workshop, we talked about Dale Carnegie’s <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> - a popular self-help book about leadership and social skills. One of the “Six Ways To Make People Like You” is:</p>
<p><strong>“Remember that a person’s name is, to that person, the sweetest and most important sound in any language.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The average person is more interested in their own name than in all the other names in the world put together. People love their names so much that they will often donate large amounts of money just to have a building named after themselves. We can make people feel extremely valued and important by remembering their name.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if your name is the most important thing, it must be pretty annoying to be told that your name is wrong or invalid. Let’s look at two examples.</p>
<h2 id="“Your-last-name-contains-invalid-characters”-John-Graham-Cumming"><a href="#“Your-last-name-contains-invalid-characters”-John-Graham-Cumming" class="headerlink" title="“Your last name contains invalid characters”, John Graham-Cumming"></a><em>“Your last name contains invalid characters”</em>, John Graham-Cumming</h2><p><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dt4ksD7hyDE/TBnnDsvwQZI/AAAAAAAAABU/DDEcLF5pRM8/s400/Picture+4.png" alt="rude" title="rude"></p>
<p>John Graham-Cumming wrote a blog post titled <em>“Your last name contains invalid characters”</em> that shared his frustrations with how web forms deal with his hyphenated last name. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Does the web site have any idea how rude it is to claim that my last name contains invalid characters? Clearly not. What they actually meant is: our web site will not accept that hyphen in your last name. But do they say that? No, of course not. They decide to shove in my face the claim that there’s something wrong with my name.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dt4ksD7hyDE/TBnslqG0VXI/AAAAAAAAABk/1tJk4xSAX5Y/s400/Picture+6.png" alt="Yahoo" title="Yahoo"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Yahoo oddly believes that I don’t know how to type my own name and decides to lowercase the C in Cumming. It’s willing to accept the hyphen but not that I know who I am.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong with my name […] What is wrong is that way this is being handled. If the system can’t cope with non-letters and spaces it needs to say that.”</p>
<p>“So, form designers: stop blaming the user for your inadequacies.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="“Hello-I’m-Mr-Null-My-Name-Makes-Me-Invisible-to-Computers”-Christopher-Null"><a href="#“Hello-I’m-Mr-Null-My-Name-Makes-Me-Invisible-to-Computers”-Christopher-Null" class="headerlink" title="“Hello, I’m Mr. Null. My Name Makes Me Invisible to Computers”, Christopher Null"></a><em>“Hello, I’m Mr. Null. My Name Makes Me Invisible to Computers”</em>, Christopher Null</h2><p>Christopher Null writes in WIRED about his experience with web forms due to his last name.</p>
<p>As we know, <strong>null</strong> is a reserved string in some languages (like SQL) that is used to indicate that a data value does not exist.</p>
<p>Null writes that he often has problems with web forms where entering his last name “Null” will not work. In these cases, he has to come up with a workaround, like using his last name in combination with a middle name, or adding a period, as “Null.”</p>
<p>He also frequently gets snail mail from providers like American Express with his last name omitted, or addressed to simply “Mr.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Getting back to “Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names,” probably the simplest falsehood is that people have a first and last name. Different cultures deal with names differently. It is common to have the family name go first, and it is also common for a person to have a single name, or more than two names…</p>
<p>Below is a brief excerpt from the list of “Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names”:</p>
<ul>
<li>People have exactly one canonical full name.</li>
<li>People have exactly one full name which they go by.</li>
<li>People’s names fit within a certain defined amount of space.</li>
<li>People’s names do not change.</li>
<li>People’s names are written in ASCII.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be somewhat obvious, but if someone’s name is their favorite word in any language, we should refrain from telling them their names are invalid…</p>
