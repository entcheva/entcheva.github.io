        <p>“Falsehoods Programmers Believe” is a collection compiled by Kevin Deldycke at <a href="https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood" target="_blank" rel="external">Awesome Falsehood</a>. Falsehoods Programmers Believe are misconceptions or assumptions than can negatively impact programming decisions and our codebase. There are falsehoods in many categories including human identity, shopping, music, date and time, and more. The initial blog post that started it all is titled <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/" target="_blank" rel="external">“<em>Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names</em>“</a> by Patrick McKenzie.</p>
<p>Dale Carnegie’s <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> is a popular book on says that “a person’s name is, to that person, the sweetest and most important sound in any language.” If we believe that to be at least anecdotally true, then getting someone’s name wrong, or worse, telling them that their name is invalid, is one of the careless mistakes that we can make as programmers.</p>
<p>Let’s look at two real-life examples where someone’s name was deemed invalid by poor software design.</p>
<h4 id="“Your-last-name-contains-invalid-characters”"><a href="#“Your-last-name-contains-invalid-characters”" class="headerlink" title="“Your last name contains invalid characters”"></a>“Your last name contains invalid characters”</h4><p><img src="/images/invalid.png" alt=""></p>
<p>John Graham-Cumming wrote a blog post titled <a href="http://blog.jgc.org/2010/06/your-last-name-contains-invalid.html" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>“Your last name contains invalid characters”</em></a> where he shares his personal experience and frustrations with how web forms deal with his hyphenated last name. The hyphen in his last name is treated by many web forms as invalid input. He says, “Does the web site have any idea how rude it is to claim that my last name contains invalid characters? Clearly not. What they actually meant is: our web site will not accept that hyphen in your last name. But do they say that? No, of course not. They decide to shove in my face the claim that there’s something wrong with my name.”</p>
<p><img src="/images/invalid2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Additionally, some web forms will accept the hyphen in his name but have rules about how to deal with what comes after the hyphen. Graham-Cumming says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Yahoo oddly believes that I don’t know how to type my own name and decides to lowercase the C in Cumming. It’s willing to accept the hyphen but not that I know who I am.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of these experiences highlight how our own preconceptions about norms, specifically names in this case, can cause frustration for users who do not fit into our preconceived mold.</p>
<p>Graham-Cumming says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong with my name […] What is wrong is the way this is being handled. If the system can’t cope with non-letters and spaces it needs to say that. […] So, form designers: stop blaming the user for your inadequacies.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="“Hello-I’m-Mr-Null-My-Name-Makes-Me-Invisible-to-Computers”"><a href="#“Hello-I’m-Mr-Null-My-Name-Makes-Me-Invisible-to-Computers”" class="headerlink" title="“Hello, I’m Mr. Null. My Name Makes Me Invisible to Computers”"></a>“Hello, I’m Mr. Null. My Name Makes Me Invisible to Computers”</h4><p>Christopher Null writes in WIRED about his experience with web forms due to his last name.</p>
<p>As we know, <strong>null</strong> is a reserved string in some languages (like SQL) that is used to indicate that a data value does not exist.</p>
<p>Null writes that he often has problems with web forms where entering his last name “Null” will not work. In these cases, he has to come up with a workaround, like using his last name in combination with a middle name, or adding a period, as “Null.”</p>
<p>He also frequently gets snail mail from providers like American Express with his last name omitted, or addressed to simply “Mr.”</p>
<h4 id="Falsehoods-Programmers-Believe-About-Names"><a href="#Falsehoods-Programmers-Believe-About-Names" class="headerlink" title="Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names"></a>Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names</h4><p>In his blog post <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/" target="_blank" rel="external">“<em>Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names</em>“</a> Patrick McKenzie says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Anything someone tells you is their name is — by definition — an appropriate identifier for them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As programmers, we are often concerned about preventing bad data from entering our database, but can make poor decisions that exclude individuals or groups as a result. We should be mindful of</p>
<p>Probably the simplest falsehood that programmers believe about names is that people have a first and last name. Different cultures deal with names differently. It is common to have the family name go first, and it is also common for a person to have a single name, or more than two names… the variations go on and on, and there is no one standard that is or should be canonical.</p>
