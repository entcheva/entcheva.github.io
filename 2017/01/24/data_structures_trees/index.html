        <p>During the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Flatiron-School-Presents/events/236670613/" target="_blank" rel="external">junior developer panel</a> at Flatiron School, when asked about typical interview questions, one of the panelists mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“write a function that gets the depth of a tree”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hear and read about trees often and I don’t really know what they are, so I thought this was a good opportunity to get into it a little bit.</p>
<h2 id="Cracking-The-Coding-Interview"><a href="#Cracking-The-Coding-Interview" class="headerlink" title="Cracking The Coding Interview"></a>Cracking The Coding Interview</h2><p>On page 47 (10% into the book) of Cracking the Coding Interview, <a href="https://www.careercup.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Gayle Laakmann McDowell</a> outlines the “absolute must have basics” of data structures and algorithms to know for an interview:<br><img src="/images/ctci.jpg" alt=""><br>I want to qualify this post by mentioning that while this book is really useful and comprehensive, it is seemingly geared toward the “Stanford Big Four” set - kids who graduated from Stanford and are vying to work at Google, Facebook, Apple, or Microsoft. That’s not what I’m interested in, but in any case it’s an interesting book, and it’s good to know what some other parts of the tech industry are expecting and/or bringing to the table. And as we heard in the junior developer panel, it is likely that you will be asked some sort of CS questions during the interview process.</p>
<p>McDowell mentions the above as being the absolute basics of CS concepts to know - I also think it’s important to note that CS grads can also swing the other way, with lots of theoretical knowledge and no practical experience. I personally know CS grads who had a hard time in the job hunt process because of their lack of practical experience.</p>
<p>Anyway, these are all qualifiers to clarify that we should not feel bad that we don’t know McDowell’s “absolute basics” and not feel like we have to compare ourselves in any way - the only goal is greater knowledge.</p>
<p>As per the table above, <a href="https://entcheva.github.io/2016/12/15/intro-to-algorithms/">my first post on Intro to Algorithms</a> briefly touched on the binary search algorithm - basically an approach of divide and conquer to find a . Here’s a reminder gif (top half):<br><img src="/images/binary-search.gif" alt="Binary Search"></p>
<h2 id="Basic-Definition-Of-Trees"><a href="#Basic-Definition-Of-Trees" class="headerlink" title="Basic Definition Of Trees"></a>Basic Definition Of Trees</h2><p>Any of these algorithms and data structures are hard to talk about in three minutes, but as an introduction, my goal for this blog post is to share:</p>
<ol>
<li>definitions and differences between <strong>tree</strong> and a <strong>binary tree</strong> data structures</li>
<li>real life examples of each<!-- 3. very basics of what it actually means to write a function to get the depth of a tree -->
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="What-A-Tree-Is-Not"><a href="#What-A-Tree-Is-Not" class="headerlink" title="What A Tree Is Not"></a>What A Tree Is Not</h3><p>What a tree is not: a tree is not a linearly organized data structure, like an array or a linked list. <strong>A data structure is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence.</strong> A hash is also not a linearly organized data structure because its order of return cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<h3 id="General-vs-Binary-Trees"><a href="#General-vs-Binary-Trees" class="headerlink" title="General vs. Binary Trees"></a>General vs. Binary Trees</h3><p><img src="/images/generalTree.jpg" alt=""><br>A <strong>general tree</strong> is a data structure with nodes. There is no limit on the degree of nodes in a general tree, and each node can have an infinite number of children.</p>
<p>Real life examples of general trees:<br><img src="/images/tree2.png" alt=""><br><img src="/images/tree3.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/images/binaryTree.jpg" alt=""><br>A <strong>binary tree</strong> is a data structure in that each node has at most two nodes: left and right.</p>
<p>Real life examples of binary trees:<br><img src="" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Advantages-Of-Trees"><a href="#Advantages-Of-Trees" class="headerlink" title="Advantages Of Trees"></a>Advantages Of Trees</h2><p>Trees are useful and frequently used because they have some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trees <strong>reflect structural relationships</strong> in the data</li>
<li>Trees are used to <strong>represent hierarchies</strong></li>
<li>Trees provide an <strong>efficient insertion and searching</strong></li>
<li>Trees are <strong>very flexible</strong> data, allowing to <strong>move subtrees around with minimum effort</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Techniques-For-Traversing-A-Binary-Tree"><a href="#Techniques-For-Traversing-A-Binary-Tree" class="headerlink" title="Techniques For Traversing A Binary Tree"></a>Techniques For Traversing A Binary Tree</h2><p>Traversing a tree can either take a breadth-first or a depth-first approach.</p>
<h3 id="Breadth-First-Search"><a href="#Breadth-First-Search" class="headerlink" title="Breadth First Search"></a>Breadth First Search</h3><p>Explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.</p>
<p><img src="/images/breadthFirst2.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There are three different types of depth-first traversals:</p>
<ul>
<li>PreOrder traversal - visit the parent first and then left and right children</li>
<li>InOrder traversal - visit the left child, then the parent and the right child</li>
<li>PostOrder traversal - visit left child, then the right child and then the parent</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/breadthTraversals.bmp" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="Depth-First-Search"><a href="#Depth-First-Search" class="headerlink" title="Depth First Search"></a>Depth First Search</h3><p>Explores all the children of a neighboring node before moving to the next neighbor and its children.</p>
<p><img src="/images/depthFirst2.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There is only one kind of breadth-first traversal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level order traversal. This traversal visits nodes by levels from <strong>top to bottom and from left to right.</strong></li>
</ul>
