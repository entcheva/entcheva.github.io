        <p>During the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Flatiron-School-Presents/events/236670613/" target="_blank" rel="external">junior developer panel</a> at Flatiron School, when asked about typical interview questions, one of the panelists mentioned getting the task to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“write a function that gets the depth of a tree”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hear and read about trees a lot and I don’t really know what they are, so I thought this was a good opportunity to get into it a little bit and at least find out what a tree is.</p>
<p>On page 47 (10% into the book) of Cracking the Coding Interview, <a href="https://www.careercup.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Gayle Laakmann McDowell</a> outlines the “absolute must have basics” of data structures and algorithms to know for an interview:<br><img src="/images/ctci.jpg" alt=""><br>I want to qualify this post by mentioning that while this book is really useful and comprehensive, it is seemingly geared toward the “Stanford Big Four” set - kids who graduated from Stanford and are vying to work at Google, Facebook, Apple, or Microsoft. That’s not what I’m interested in, but in any case it’s an interesting book, and it’s good to know what some other parts of the tech industry are expecting and/or bringing to the table. And as we heard in the junior developer panel, it is likely that you will be asked some sort of CS questions during the interview process.</p>
<p>McDowell mentions the above as being the absolute basics of CS concepts to know - I also think it’s important to note that CS grads can also swing the other way, with lots of theoretical knowledge and no practical experience. I personally know CS grads who had a hard time in the job hunt process because of their lack of practical experience.</p>
<p>Anyway, these are all qualifiers to clarify that we should not feel bad that we don’t know McDowell’s “absolute basics” and not feel like we have to compare ourselves in any way - the only goal is greater knowledge.</p>
<p>As per the table above, <a href="https://entcheva.github.io/2016/12/15/intro-to-algorithms/">my first post on Intro to Algorithms</a> briefly touched on the binary search algorithm - basically an approach of divide and conquer to find a . Here’s a reminder gif (top half):<br><img src="/images/binary-search.gif" alt="Binary Search"></p>
<p>Any of these algorithms and data structures are hard to talk about in three minutes, but as an introduction, here are the:</p>
<ol>
<li>definition of a tree data structure</li>
<li>real life examples of tree data structures</li>
<li>definition of a binary tree</li>
<li>real life examples of a binary tree<!-- 5. very basics of what it actually means to write a function to get the depth of a tree. -->
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>general tree</strong> is a data structure in that each node can have infinite number of children, A <strong>binary tree</strong> is a data structure in that each node has at most two nodes left and right. There is no limit on the degree of node in a general tree. Nodes in a binary tree cannot have more than degree 2</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="What-is-a-tree"><a href="#What-is-a-tree" class="headerlink" title="What is a tree?"></a>What is a tree?</h2><ul>
<li>what a tree is not: it is not a linearly organized data structure. A linked list is a data structure that is linearly organized. An array is also linearly organized. In contrast, a tree is not linearly organized.</li>
<li>a tree is…</li>
</ul>
<p>A simple unordered tree:<br><img src="/images/tree1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Real life examples of trees:<br><img src="/images/tree2.png" alt=""><br><img src="/images/tree3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Searching a tree is more complicated than a linearly organized data structure like an array or linked list.</p>
